# State-search-algorithms-implementation

This code implements 5 state search algorithms - BFS, DFS, Iterative Deepening, Greedy Best First Search and Astar on a variant of N-puzzle. The variant is called R-B-G puzzle, where B is the Blank cell on the grid and the goal of the puzzle is to move the B cell corresponding to the goal grid, while also keeping in mind the respective position of R and G cells wrt to B. 

To run this code - 
- Download all the files to a folder.
- On terminal, go to the folder containing the files.
- Run python main.py

To use the code - 
- Files ast.txt, 3.txt, 4.txt, P3.txt, 6.txt are the problem puzzle grids. Feel free to create more puzzle grids.
- Files gstar.txt, g3.txt, g4.txt, goal.txt, g6.txt are the goal configurations for the problem grids, used as final state for the puzzles.
- After running the code, prompt asks to choose among 5 algorithms to choose from. Next when problem is asked, please give any of the problem puzzle file names. For goal grids, choose among respective goal grid(the grid size of problem and goal should be same )
